# sync

 A stupid program to interpret a YAML-based copying language.

 This program can look amongst drives, filter by what looks like a
 digital camera, filter others by what looks like the main home
 computer, then copy files that match yet another filter from one
 set of drives to one of the others.

 The idea is that we can alter the YAML when things change
 instead of mucking around with code; and when we need more
 functionality we can adapt the code to make the YAML more
 powerful.
